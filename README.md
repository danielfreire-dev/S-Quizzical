# React + Vite

This project was created as a challenge from the Scrimba "Learning React" course.
In this project I learned how to use `useState` to render the information as it is received by the app and `useEffect` to filter out some app behaviours.
It was also a good opportunity to learn about the `fetch` method and how to use it to fetch data from an API.
Also, I learned how forms work in the React world and how to extract and filter this data.
